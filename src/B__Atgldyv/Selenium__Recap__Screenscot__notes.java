 * //Using Selenium we can take screenShots Using ScreenShot interface.
		//1.we need to downcast WebDriver obj to Screenshot and create a variable of TakesScreenshot
		TakesScreenshot ts=(TakesScreenshot)driver;
		//for ex whenever we copy or take the screenshots it is saved inside of clipboard until we paste or put that screenshot somewhere
//2.we have File interface for saving screenshots in selenium, so we use .getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE) method for creating that File variable
	File screen=ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);//this will return File type screenshot, this screenshot is hanging there
//3. Copy that file and identify which file and tell the destination file path inside parameters
	try{
		FileUtils.copyFile(screen, new File("ScreenShots/TakeScreenShots.png"));
	}catch(IOException e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
